## Version 1.1 ##

**Released: 2013-02-11**

New features:

  * In-built functionality to start RealTemp4RTSS on user login (current/all)
  * Periodic checks for new versions
  * Added current time to OSD options

Other things:

  * Tidied a few bits of code
  * (Hopefully) remembered to include settings file with release version so that it actually works for someone other than me!
